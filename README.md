# NZP prototype 2023-02-26

## Requirements

- any web server. I used [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) for development.  Example usage:

```bash
cd /path/to/this/project
live-server ./ --entry-file=index.html
```

This should open a browser window with the project running.

# Decision considerations
- self-contained
- simple -- no build process required because for something this simple, it _should not_ be necessary.
- high functionality for lower investment
- time restriction
- using known technologies
- @TODO write this stuff out!
